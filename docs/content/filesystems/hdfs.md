# HDFS

You don't need any additional dependencies to access HDFS because you have already taken care of the Hadoop dependencies.

## HDFS Configuration

For HDFS, the most important thing is to be able to read your HDFS configuration. Choose one of the following ways to configure your HDFS:

- Set environment variable `HADOOP_HOME` (if in a hadoop environment, it is already set up).
- Configure `'fs.hdfs.hadoopconf'` in the catalog.
- Set environment variable `HADOOP_CONF_DIR`.
- Configure `'hadoop.'` prefix options in the catalog.

## Hadoop-compatible file systems (HCFS)

All Hadoop file systems are automatically available when the Hadoop libraries are on the classpath.

This way, Paimon seamlessly supports all of Hadoop file systems implementing the `org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem`
interface, and all Hadoop-compatible file systems (HCFS).

- HDFS
- Alluxio (see configuration specifics below)
- XtreemFS
- â€¦

The Hadoop configuration has to have an entry for the required file system implementation in the `core-site.xml` file.

For Alluxio support add the following entry into the core-site.xml file:

```shell
<property>
  <name>fs.alluxio.impl</name>
  <value>alluxio.hadoop.FileSystem</value>
</property>
```

## HDFS HA

Ensure that `hdfs-site.xml` and `core-site.xml` contain the necessary [HA configuration](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HDFSHighAvailabilityWithNFS.html).

## Kerberos

Ensure that `hdfs-site.xml` and `core-site.xml` contain the necessary [Kerberos configuration](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SecureMode.html).
