# Quick Start
This document describes how to use Docker and Docker Compose 
to quickly build a big data environment such as Paimon and 
the big data engine Flink/Spark. 
You can see more runtime information between Paimon and 
Flink/Spark by looking at the corresponding section in the 
documentation.

The following steps have been tested on a Windows 11 laptop 
with docker desktop and docker compose installed.

## Prerequisites
windows/Linux/MacOS

docker desktop for windows/Applicable to the docker of the corresponding system

docker compose

## Quick start paimon and flink

Look at the version mapping between paimon and Flink 
in the [Engines/Flink](https://paimon.apache.org/docs/master/engines/flink/) section of the document and select 
the version you want.

### Docker compose

docker compose is a convenient way to manage docker containers and quickly build the application environment 
you need. The following docker compose file is composed of three services, jobmanager, taskmanager and sql-client
, using the flink:1.17.1-scala_2.12 image.

Copy the following into a ```flink_docker_compose.yml``` file.

> Notice:
> 
> The /tmp path in the container is mapped to the local./tmp path so that multiple containers can share a file system path. The reason is because the 'warehouse'='file:/tmp/paimon' option is configured when the catalog is created. If you use another path as the warehouse address, modify the volumes option in the docker compose file simultaneously.

```shell

version: "2.2"
services:
  jobmanager:
    image: flink:1.17.1-scala_2.12
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    command: jobmanager
    user: flink
    environment:

        FLINK_PROPERTIES=
        jobmanager.rpc.address: jobmanager
    networks:

    networks:

      - ./tmp:/tmp

networks:
  flink-network:
    driver: bridge

```

### Step 1: Prepare the dependent jar files

Reading [Engines/Flink](https://paimon.apache.org/docs/master/engines/flink/) chapters, Download the appropriate versions of the ```paimon-flink-{{< version >}}.jar``` and ```flink-shaded-hadoop-2-uber-{{< version >}}.jar``` files to the specified path

For example, ```./incubator-paimon/docker/custom_jars```.

After creating a new custom_jars folder under the path```./incubator-paimon/docker/```, place the required jar files into it.

The file I downloaded here is ```flink-shaded-hadoop-2-uber-2.8.3-10.0.jar``` and ```paimon-flink-1.17-0.5-20230815.001819-123.jar```

With the jar files ready, you next need to place the ```flink_docker_compose.yml``` docker compose file in the ```./incubator-paimon/docker/``` path.

We can then quickly start the cluster through docker compose.

### Step 2: Start the flink cluster with docker compose
Open a CMD window and run the commands shown below.

#### 2.1 Switch to the specified path
```shell
cd ./incubator-paimon/docker/
```

#### 2.2 Start the Flink cluster
```shell
PS .\incubator-paimon\docker> docker-compose -f flink_docker_compose.yml up -d jobmanager taskmanager
[+] Running 3/3
 - Network docker_flink-network    Created                                                                                                                                                                  0.1s
 - Container docker-jobmanager-1   Started                                                                                                                                                                  1.1s
 - Container docker-taskmanager-1  Started                                                                                                                                                                  1.5s
```
You can now access the Flink Web UI at ```http://localhost:8081/``` .

#### 2.3 Use interactive mode to start an SQL-client for executing SQL
```shell

Flink SQL>
```
Now you have an sql client that can interact.

Here you can continue to execute a variety of SQL code.

### Step 3: Create the paimon catalog and write and query the data

#### 3.1 Create Catalog

Use CREATE CATALOG my_catalog WITH (...) Statement creates a catalog named my_catalog.

> Note the 'warehouse'='file:/tmp/paimon' configuration here, which should be mentioned above in docker compose.
```shell
Flink SQL> CREATE CATALOG my_catalog WITH (
>     'type'='paimon',
>     'warehouse'='file:/tmp/paimon'
> );
[INFO] Execute statement succeed.

Flink SQL> USE CATALOG my_catalog;
[INFO] Execute statement succeed.

```

#### 3.2 Create Table

```shell
Flink SQL> CREATE TABLE word_count (
>     word STRING PRIMARY KEY NOT ENFORCED,
>     cnt BIGINT
> );
[INFO] Execute statement succeed.

Flink SQL> CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE word_table (
>     word STRING
> ) WITH (
>     'connector' = 'datagen',
>     'fields.word.length' = '1'
> );
[INFO] Execute statement succeed.

Flink SQL> SET 'execution.checkpointing.interval' = '10 s';
[INFO] Execute statement succeed.

```

#### 3.3 Insert Data To a Table

```shell
Flink SQL> INSERT INTO word_count SELECT word, COUNT(*) FROM word_table GROUP BY word;
[INFO] Submitting SQL update statement to the cluster...
Flink SQL> INSERT INTO word_count SELECT word, COUNT(*) FROM word_table GROUP BY word;[INFO] SQL update statement has been successfully submitted to the cluster:
Job ID: 19bc54af8dbbf44a90aae79e8534af2e

```

You should see a running job in the Flink Web UI. In the Flink Web UI you can view the detailed runtime information of the job.

#### 3.4 Query data from a table

```shell

Flink SQL>
> SET 'sql-client.execution.result-mode' = 'tableau';
[INFO] Execute statement succeed.

Flink SQL> RESET 'execution.checkpointing.interval';
[INFO] Execute statement succeed.

Flink SQL> SET 'execution.runtime-mode' = 'batch';
[INFO] Execute statement succeed.

Flink SQL> SELECT * FROM word_count;
+------+-------+
| word |   cnt |
+------+-------+

|    f | 42597 |
+------+-------+
16 rows in set

Flink SQL>
> SET 'execution.runtime-mode' = 'streaming';
[INFO] Execute statement succeed.

Flink SQL> SELECT `interval`, COUNT(*) AS interval_cnt FROM
