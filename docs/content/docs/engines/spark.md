# Spark

Table Store supports reading table store tables through Spark.

## Version

Table Store supports Spark 3+. It is highly recommended to use Spark 3+ version with many improvements.

## Install

{{< stable >}}
Download [flink-table-store-spark-{{< version >}}.jar](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/flink/flink-table-store-spark/{{< version >}}/flink-table-store-spark-{{< version >}}.jar).
{{< /stable >}}
{{< unstable >}}
You are using an unreleased version of Table Store, you need to manually [Build Spark Bundled Jar]({{< ref "docs/engines/build" >}}) from the source code.
{{< /unstable >}}

Copy Table Store Spark bundle jar to `spark/jars`.

## Table Store Catalog

The following command registers the Table Store's Spark catalog with the name `table_store`:

```bash
spark-sql --conf spark.sql.catalog.table_store=org.apache.flink.table.store.spark.SparkCatalog \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.table_store.warehouse=file:/tmp/warehouse
```

## Create Temporary View

Use the `CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW` command to create a Spark mapping table on top of
an existing Table Store table if you don't want to use Table Store Catalog.

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW myTable
USING tablestore
OPTIONS (
  path "file:/tmp/warehouse/default.db/myTable"
)
```

## Query Table

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_store.default.myTable;
```
