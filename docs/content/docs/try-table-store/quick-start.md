# Quick Start

This document provides a quick introduction to using Flink Table Store. Readers of this
document will be guided to create a simple dynamic table to read and write it.

## Step 1: Downloading Flink

{{< hint info >}}
__Note:__ Table Store is only supported starting from Flink 1.15.
{{< /hint >}}

[Download the latest binary release](https://flink.apache.org/downloads.html) of Flink,
then extract the archive:

```bash
tar -xzf flink-*.tgz
```

## Step 2: Copy Table Store Bundle Jar

{{< stable >}}
[Download the latest bundle jar](https://flink.apache.org/downloads.html) of
Flink Table Store.
{{< /stable >}}
{{< unstable >}}

You are using an unreleased version of Table Store, in order to build Table Store
bundle jar you need the source code.

To clone from git, enter:

```bash
git clone {{< github_repo >}}
```

The simplest way of building Table Store is by running:

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

You can find the bundle jar in `"./flink-table-store-dist/target/flink-table-store-dist-*.jar"`.

{{< /unstable >}}

Copy table store bundle jar to flink/lib:

```bash
cp flink-table-store-dist-*.jar FLINK_HOME/lib/
```

## Step 3: Copy Hadoop Bundle Jar

[Download](https://flink.apache.org/downloads.html) Pre-bundled Hadoop.

```bash
cp flink-shaded-hadoop-2-uber-*.jar FLINK_HOME/lib/
```

## Step 4: Start Flink Local Cluster

In order to run multiple jobs, you need to modify the cluster configuration:

```bash
vi ./conf/flink-conf.yaml

taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots: 2
```

To start a local cluster, run the bash script that comes with Flink:

```bash
./bin/start-cluster.sh
```

You should be able to navigate to the web UI at [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to view
the Flink dashboard and see that the cluster is up and running.

Start the SQL Client CLI:

```bash
./bin/sql-client.sh embedded
```

## Step 5: Create Dynamic Table

```sql
-- set root path to session config
SET 'table-store.file.path' = '/tmp/table_store';

-- create a word count dynamic table without 'connector' option
CREATE TABLE word_count (
    word STRING PRIMARY KEY NOT ENFORCED,
    cnt BIGINT
);
```

## Step 6: Write Data

```sql
-- create a word data generator table
CREATE TABLE word_table (
    word STRING
) WITH (
    'connector' = 'datagen',
    'fields.word.length' = '1'
);

-- table store requires checkpoint interval in streaming mode
SET 'execution.checkpointing.interval' = '10 s';

-- write streaming data to dynamic table
INSERT INTO word_count SELECT word, COUNT(*) FROM word_table GROUP BY word;
```

## Step 7: OLAP Query

```sql
-- use tableau result mode
SET 'sql-client.execution.result-mode' = 'tableau';

-- switch to batch mode
RESET 'execution.checkpointing.interval';
SET 'execution.runtime-mode' = 'batch';

-- olap query the table
SELECT * FROM word_count;
```

You can execute the query multiple times and observe the changes in the results.

## Step 8: Streaming Query

```sql
-- switch to streaming mode
SET 'execution.runtime-mode' = 'streaming';

-- track the changes of table and calculate the count interval statistics
SELECT `interval`, COUNT(*) AS interval_cnt FROM
  (SELECT cnt / 10000 AS `interval` FROM word_count) GROUP BY `interval`;
```

With the streaming mode, you can get the change log of the dynamic table,
and perform new stream computations.

## Step 9: Exit

Cancel streaming job in [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).

```sql
-- drop the dynamic table, clear the files
DROP TABLE word_count;

-- exit sql-client
EXIT;
```

Stop the Flink local cluster:

```bash
./bin/stop-cluster.sh
```

## Congratulation!

You have completed the Flink Table Store Quick Start.
