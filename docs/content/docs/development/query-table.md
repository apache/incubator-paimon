# Query Table

The Table Store is streaming batch unified, you can read full
and incremental data depending on the runtime execution mode:

```sql
-- Batch mode, read latest snapshot
SET 'execution.runtime-mode' = 'batch';
SELECT * FROM MyTable;

-- Streaming mode, read incremental snapshot, read the snapshot first, then read the incremental
SET 'execution.runtime-mode' = 'streaming';
SELECT * FROM MyTable;

-- Streaming mode, read latest incremental
SET 'execution.runtime-mode' = 'streaming';
SELECT * FROM MyTable /*+ OPTIONS ('log.scan'='latest') */;
```

## Query Optimization

It is highly recommended to specify partition and primary key filters
along with the query, which will speed up the data skipping of the query.
along with the query, which will speed up the data skipping of the query.

Supported filter functions are:
- `=`
- `<>`
- `<`
- `<=`
- `>`
- `>=`
- `in`
- starts with `like`

## Real-time Streaming Consumption

By default, data is only visible after the checkpoint, which means
that the streaming reading has transactional consistency.

Immediate data visibility is configured via
`log.consistency` = `eventual`.

Due to the tradeoff between data freshness and completeness, immediate data visibility is barely
accomplished under exactly-once semantics. Nevertheless, users can relax the constraint to use
at-least-once mode to achieve it. Note that records may be sent to downstream jobs ahead of the committing
(since no barrier alignment is required), which may lead to duplicate data during job failover. As a result,
users may need to manually de-duplicate data to achieve final consistency.
