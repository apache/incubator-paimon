# Write Table

```sql
INSERT { INTO | OVERWRITE } [catalog_name.][db_name.]table_name
  [PARTITION part_spec] [column_list] select_statement

part_spec:
  (part_col_name1=val1 [, part_col_name2=val2, ...])

column_list:
  (col_name1 [, column_name2, ...])
```

## Parallelism

It is recommended that the parallelism of sink should be less than or
equal to the number of buckets, preferably equal. You can control the
parallelism of the sink with the `sink.parallelism` option.

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 20%">Option</th>
      <th class="text-center" style="width: 5%">Required</th>
      <th class="text-center" style="width: 5%">Default</th>
      <th class="text-center" style="width: 10%">Type</th>
      <th class="text-center" style="width: 60%">Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><h5>sink.parallelism</h5></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td style="word-wrap: break-word;">(none)</td>
      <td>Integer</td>
      <td>Defines the parallelism of the sink operator. By default, the parallelism is determined by the framework using the same parallelism of the upstream chained operator.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Expiring Snapshot

Table Store generates one or two snapshots per commit. To avoid too many snapshots 
that create a lot of small files and redundant storage, Table Store writes defaults
to eliminate expired snapshots:

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 20%">Option</th>
      <th class="text-center" style="width: 5%">Required</th>
      <th class="text-center" style="width: 5%">Default</th>
      <th class="text-center" style="width: 10%">Type</th>
      <th class="text-center" style="width: 60%">Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><h5>snapshot.time-retained</h5></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td style="word-wrap: break-word;">1 h</td>
      <td>Duration</td>
      <td>The maximum time of completed snapshots to retain.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><h5>snapshot.num-retained.min</h5></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td style="word-wrap: break-word;">10</td>
      <td>Integer</td>
      <td>The minimum number of completed snapshots to retain.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><h5>snapshot.num-retained.max</h5></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td style="word-wrap: break-word;">Integer.MAX_VALUE</td>
      <td>Integer</td>
      <td>The maximum number of completed snapshots to retain.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Please note that too short retain time or too small retain number may result in:
- Batch query cannot find the file. For example, the table is relatively large and
  the batch query takes 10 minutes to read, but the snapshot from 10 minutes ago
  expires, at which point the batch query will read a deleted snapshot.
- Continuous reading jobs on FileStore (Without Log System) fail to restart. At the
  time of the job failover, the snapshot it recorded has expired.

## Performance

Table Store uses LSM data structure, which itself has the ability to support a large
number of updates. Update performance and query performance is a tradeoff, the
following parameters control this tradeoff:

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 20%">Option</th>
      <th class="text-center" style="width: 5%">Required</th>
      <th class="text-center" style="width: 5%">Default</th>
      <th class="text-center" style="width: 10%">Type</th>
      <th class="text-center" style="width: 60%">Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><h5>num-sorted-run.compaction-trigger</h5></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td style="word-wrap: break-word;">5</td>
      <td>Integer</td>
      <td>The sorted run number to trigger compaction. Includes level0 files (one file one sorted run) and high-level runs (one level one sorted run).</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

The compaction-trigger determines the frequency of compaction. The smaller the number of
sorted run, the more compaction occurs, and the larger the number of sorted run, the less compaction occurs.

- The larger `num-sorted-run.compaction-trigger`, the less merge cost when updating data, which
  can avoid many invalid merges. However, if this value is too large, more memory 
  will be needed when merging files because each FileReader will take up a lot of
  memory.

- The smaller `num-sorted-run.compaction-trigger`, the better performance when querying, fewer
  files will be merged.

## Write Stalls

The Writer automatically maintains the structure of the LSM, which means that there
will be asynchronous threads constantly compaction, but if write speed is faster than the
compaction speed, write stalls may occur. Writing will be stopping.

If we don't limit writing, we will have the following problems:
- Increasing space scaling, which can lead to running out of disk space.
- Increasing read amplification, which greatly reduces read performance.

The following parameters determine when to stop writing:

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 20%">Option</th>
      <th class="text-center" style="width: 5%">Required</th>
      <th class="text-center" style="width: 5%">Default</th>
      <th class="text-center" style="width: 10%">Type</th>
      <th class="text-center" style="width: 60%">Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><h5>num-sorted-run.stop-trigger</h5></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td style="word-wrap: break-word;">10</td>
      <td>Integer</td>
      <td>The number of sorted-runs that trigger the stopping of writes.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Memory

There are three main places in the Table Store's sink writer that take up memory:
- MemTable's write buffer, shared and preempted by all writers of a single task.
  This memory value can be adjusted by the `write-buffer-size` option.
- The memory consumed by compaction for reading files, can be adjusted by the
  `num-sorted-run.compaction-trigger` option to change the maximum number of files to be merged.
- The memory consumed by writing columnar (ORC) file, which is not adjustable.
