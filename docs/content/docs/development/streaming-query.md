# Streaming Query

Currently, Table Store only supports Flink streaming queries.

The Table Store is streaming batch unified, you can read full
and incremental data depending on the runtime execution mode:

```sql
-- Batch mode, read latest snapshot
SET 'execution.runtime-mode' = 'batch';
SELECT * FROM MyTable;

-- Streaming mode, streaming reading, read incremental snapshot, read the snapshot first, then read the incremental
SET 'execution.runtime-mode' = 'streaming';
SELECT * FROM MyTable;

-- Streaming mode, streaming reading, read latest incremental
SET 'execution.runtime-mode' = 'streaming';
SELECT * FROM MyTable /*+ OPTIONS ('log.scan'='latest') */;
```

Different `log.scan` mode will result in different consuming behavior under streaming mode.
<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 20%">Scan Mode</th>
      <th class="text-center" style="width: 5%">Default</th>
      <th class="text-center" style="width: 60%">Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><h5>FULL</h5></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>FULL scan mode performs a hybrid reading with a snapshot scan and the streaming incremental scan.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><h5>LATEST</h5></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>LATEST scan mode only reads incremental data from the latest offset.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Streaming Query on Files

You can choose to consume incremental changes directly from the lake store files under
streaming mode. This mode has a lower cost compared to Kafka but has a higher latency,
depending on the checkpoint interval of the writing job.

By default, the downstream streaming consumption is disordered (ordered within the key)
stream of upsert data. If you expect an ordered CDC data stream, you can configure it
as follows (recommended):

```sql
CREATE TABLE T (...)
WITH (
    'changelog-file' = 'true',
    'log.changelog-mode' = 'all'
)
```

## Streaming Query on Kafka

For a table configuring a log system like Kafka, data will be double written to the file
storage and the Kafka topic under streaming mode. For queries, there will be hybrid reads
will from incremental snapshots.

```sql
CREATE TABLE T (...)
WITH (
    'log.system' = 'kafka',
    'kafka.bootstrap.servers' = '...',
    'kafka.topic' = '...'
)
```
The partition of the Kafka topic needs to be the same as the number of buckets.

By default, data is only visible after the checkpoint, which means
that the streaming reading has transactional consistency.

Immediate data visibility is configured via
`log.consistency` = `eventual`.

Due to the tradeoff between data freshness and completeness, immediate data visibility is barely
accomplished under exactly-once semantics. Nevertheless, users can relax the constraint to use
at-least-once mode to achieve it. Note that records may be sent to downstream jobs ahead of the committing
(since no barrier alignment is required), which may lead to duplicate data during job failover. As a result,
users may need to manually de-duplicate data to achieve final consistency.
